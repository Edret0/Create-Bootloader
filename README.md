# Create-Bootloader
This simple project is to create a simple kernel and have the bootloader locate it so I can see how it works

Pushed source code of the bootloader and kernel into this repo as I have used grub-mkresuce which it has GPL copyright
infringement if this is ever redistributed. The bootloader and the iso have been pushed on the repo to satisy the GPL.
